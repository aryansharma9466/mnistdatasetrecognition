# MNIST Digit Classification using LeNet-5
This project implements the classic LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Model: LeNet-5, a pioneering CNN architecture.

Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database).

Framework: Built with TensorFlow and Keras.

Objective: To achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits 0-9.

Usage: Clone the repository and run python lenet5_mnist.py.

Requirements: tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib.

Outcome: The model typically achieves ~99% accuracy on the test set.
